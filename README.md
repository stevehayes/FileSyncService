# File Sync Service
An Example of a service that syncs two local folders. As it currently sits the test project is setup and pretty much ready to go. The orchestrator tests are running, however I haven't yet got a chance to get to getting tests for the rest of the services. 

# How to run the tests
Load the project up in Visual Studio and use the built in NUnit test runner to run the tests. Again, please note that they are not yet finished.
